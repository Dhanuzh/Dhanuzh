### Dhanush

Just a guy on a mission to make my dev workflow crazy awesome, build blazing-fast apps, a passionate full stack engineer with a knack for making developer workflows efficient, and mastering new technologies. My ultimate goal? Craft software that makes people go, “Whoa, how’d you do that?!”

Fun Facts
* I’m obsessed with tweaking my setup—Neovim, TMUX, and terminal CLI tools are my jam. If it makes coding more fun, I’m all in.
* Skill issues :)
* Freelancer Life: I code, I conquer, I invoice. Rinse and repeat.
* When I’m not in coding mode, I’m probably leveling up my skills, whether it’s learning a new language (both programming and spoken) or figuring out the best way to track time like a boss.
* I am lord of the joker's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanush-d-84019b281/). Who said LinkedIn has to be all business, anyway?
